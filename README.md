# bosh-lite

A lite development env for BOSH using Warden from within Vagrant.

This readme also includes demonstrates how to deploy Cloud Foundry into bosh-lite.

## Installation

For all use cases, first prepare this project with `bundler` & `librarian-chef`.

1. [Install vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)

    Known to work for version:
    ```
    $ vagrant -v
    Vagrant 1.3.4
    ```
    Note: for OSX and VirtualBox you are required to use Vagrant 1.3.4+

1. Install Vagrant omnibus plugin
    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
    ```
1. Install Ruby + RubyGems + Bundler

1. Run Bundler from the base directory of this repository

    ```
    bundle
    ```

1. Run Librarian

    ```
    librarian-chef install
    ```

Below are installation processes for different Vagrant providers.

* VMWare Fusion
* Virtualbox
* AWS

### USE VMWare Fusion Provider

Known to work with Fusion version 5.0.3

1. Install vagrant Fusion Plugin + license

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
    vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
    ```


1. Start vagrant from the base directory of this repository (which uses the Vagrantfile)

    ```
    vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
    ```

1. Bosh target (login with admin/admin)

    ```
    bosh target 192.168.50.4
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: admin
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```

1. Add a set of route entries to your local route table to enable direct warden container access. Your sudo password may be required.

    ```
    scripts/add-route
    ```

###USE Virtualbox Provider


1. Start vagrant from the base directory of this repository (which uses the Vagrantfile)

    ```
    vagrant up
    ```

1. Bosh target (login with admin/admin)

    ```
    bosh target 192.168.50.4
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: admin
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```

1. Add a set of route entries to your local route table to enable direct warden container access every time your networking gets reset (eg. reboot or connect to a different network). Your sudo password may be required.

    ```
    scripts/add-route
    ```

###USE AWS Provider

1. Install Vagrant AWS provider

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
    ```

1. Add dummy AWS box

    ```
    vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box
    ```

1. Rename Vagrantfile.aws to Vagrantfile
1. Set environment variables called `BOSH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `BOSH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the appropriate values.  If you've followed along with other documentation such as [these steps to deploy Cloud Foundry on AWS](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/deploying-cf/ec2/index.html#deployment-env-prep), you may simply need to source your `bosh_environment` file.
1. Make sure the EC2 secure group you are using in the `Vagrantfile` exists and allows inbound TCP traffice on ports 25555 (for the BOSH director) and 22 (for SSH).
1. Run Vagrant from the base directory of this repository (which uses the Vagrantfile):

    ```
    vagrant up --provider=aws
    ```
    
1. Bosh target (login with admin/admin)

    ```
    bosh target 192.168.50.4
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: admin
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```    

## Troubleshooting

1. If you want to start over again, you can use `vagrant destory` from the base directory of this project to remove the VM.
1. To start with a new VM just execute the appropriate `vagrant up` command optionally with the provider option as shown in the earlier sections.

## Upload Warden stemcell

bosh-lite uses the Warden CPI, so we need to use the Warden Stemcell which will be the root file system for all Linux Containers created by the Warden CPI.

1. Upload Stemcell

    ```
    bosh upload stemcell http://bosh-jenkins-gems-warden.s3.amazonaws.com/stemcells/latest-bosh-stemcell-warden.tgz
    ```

## Deploy Cloud Foundry (Non-Spiff Approach)

1. Generate CF deployment manifest

    ```
    cp manifests/cf-stub.yml manifests/[your-name-manifest].yml
    # replace director_uuid: PLACEHOLDER-DIRECTOR-UUID in [your-name-manifest].yml with the UUID from "bosh status"
    bosh deployment manifests/[your-name-manifest].yml
    bosh diff [cf-release]/templates/cf-aws-template.yml.erb
    ./scripts/transform.rb -f manifests/[your-name-manifest].yml
    ```

    or simply
    ```
    ./scripts/make_manifest
    ```

1. Create a CF release
1. Deploy!

## Deploy Cloud Foundry (Using Spiff)

Spiff is the way that Cloud Foundry is deployed in production, and can be used for Bosh-lite installs too. 

1.  Create a deployment stub, like the one below:.  
    
    (In the rest of this section, we refer to this as being at ~/deployment-stub.yml)

    ```
    name: cf-warden
    director_uuid: [your director UUID, you can use 'bosh status' to get it, look for the UUID line]
    releases:
        - name: cf
          version: latest
    ```

1.  Generate a deployment manifest based on your stub.  

    The command will look something like:
    
    **NOTE**: This uses spiff. Install that first, see https://github.com/vito/spiff
    
    **NOTE**: This assumes you've checked out http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release to ~/cf-release. Do that first too.

    ```
    ~/cf-release/generate_deployment_manifest warden ~/deployment-stub.yml > ~/deployment.yml
    ```

1.  Bosh target 192.168.50.4 and run bosh as normal, passing your generated manifest:
    ```
    bosh create release
    bosh upload release
    bosh deployment ~/deployment.yml
    bosh deploy
    ```
1.  Run the yeti tests against your new deployment to make sure it's working correctly.

    a.  Set the environment variables VCAP_BVT_API_ENDPOINT, VCAP_BVT_ADMIN_USER, VCAP_BVT_ADMIN_USER_PASSWD

    Might look like this:
    
    ```
    # This is the router ip in bosh vms (not the cc)
    export VCAP_BVT_API_ENDPOINT=http://api.10.244.0.22.xip.io
    export VCAP_BVT_ADMIN_USER=admin
    export VCAP_BVT_ADMIN_USER_PASSWD=admin
    ```
    
    b.  Run yeti as normal from cf-release/src/tests.. e.g.
    
    ```
    bundle; bundle exec rake prepare; # create initial users/assets
    bundle exec rspec # run!
    ```
    

## SSH into deployment jobs

To use `bosh ssh` to SSH into running jobs of a deployment, you need to specify various `bosh ssh` flags to use the Vagrant VM as the gateway.

To make it simple, add the following alias to your environment:

``` bash
alias ssh_boshlite='bosh ssh --gateway_host 192.168.50.4 --gateway_user vagrant --gateway_identity_file $HOME/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key'
```

You can now SSH into any VM with `ssh_boshlite` in the same way you would run `bosh ssh`:

```
$ ssh_boshlite
1. nats/0
2. syslog_aggregator/0
3. postgres/0
4. uaa/0
5. login/0
6. cloud_controller/0
7. loggregator/0
8. loggregator-router/0
9. health_manager/0
10. dea_next/0
11. router/0
Choose an instance:
