# BOSH Lite

A local development environment for BOSH using warden containers in a Vagrant box.

This readme walks through deploying Cloud Foundry with BOSH Lite.
Bosh and BOSH Lite can be used to deploy just about anything once you've got the hang of it.

## Install

### Prepare the Environment

For all use cases, first prepare this project with `bundler` .

1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

    Known working version:

    ```
    $ vagrant -v
    Vagrant 1.4.3
    ```

    See [this blog](http://aliwahaj.blogspot.de/2014/01/installing-cloud-foundry-on-vagrant.html) for special instructions for Windows users of BOSH Lite.
    This step can be skipped when using bare-metal.

1. Install Ruby + RubyGems + Bundler.

1. Clone this repository and run Bundler from the base directory.

    ```
    bundle
    ```

### Install and Boot a (Virtual) Machine

Below are installation instructions for different Vagrant providers.

* VMWare Fusion
* Virtualbox
* AWS

Additionally there are instructions for installing bosh-lite on bare-metal.

#### Using the VMWare Fusion Provider (preferred)

Fusion is faster, more reliable and we test against it more frequently.
Both Fusion and the Vagrant Fusion provider require a license.

Known to work with Fusion version 6.0.2 and Vagrant plugin vagrant-vmware-fusion version 2.2.0 .

1. Install and launch VMWare Fusion. You need to accept the VMWare license agreement if you haven't done so already.

1. Install Vagrant Fusion Plugin and license.

    This requires a license file for Fusion. If you don't have one visit http://www.vagrantup.com to purchase a license.

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion
    vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion license.lic
    ```


1. Start Vagrant from the base directory of this repository. This uses the Vagrantfile.

    ```
    vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
    ```

1. Target the BOSH Director and login with admin/admin.

    ```
    $ bosh target 192.168.50.4 lite
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    $ bosh login
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```

1. Add a set of route entries to your local route table to enable direct Warden container access. Your sudo password may be required.

    ```
    scripts/add-route
    ```

#### Using the Virtualbox Provider


1. Start Vagrant from the base directory of this repository. This uses the Vagrantfile.

    ```
    vagrant up --provider virtualbox
    ```

1. Target the BOSH Director and login with admin/admin.

    ```
    $ bosh target 192.168.50.4 lite
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    $ bosh login
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```

1. Add a set of route entries to your local route table to enable direct Warden container access every time your networking gets reset (e.g. reboot or connect to a different network). Your sudo password may be required.

    ```
    scripts/add-route
    ```

#### Using the AWS Provider

##### EC2 Classic or VPC

The default mode provisions the BOSH-lite VM in EC2 classic. If you set the `BOSH_LITE_SUBNET_ID` environment
variable, vagrant will provision the bosh-lite VM in that subnet in whichever VPC it lives.

When deploying to a VPC, the security group must be specified as an ID of the form `sg-abcd1234`, as
opposed to a name like `default`.

NOTE: You can only deploy into a VPC if the instance can be accessed by the machine doing the deploying. If
not, Vagrant will fail to use SSH to provision the instance further. This similarly applies to steps 7-9, below.

##### Steps

1. Install Vagrant AWS provider

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
    ```

    Known to work for version: vagrant-aws 0.4.1

1. Add dummy AWS box

    ```
    vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box
    ```

1. Set environment variables called `BOSH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `BOSH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the appropriate values. If you've followed along with other documentation such as [these steps to deploy Cloud Foundry on AWS](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/deploying/ec2/bootstrap-aws-vpc.html), you may simply need to source your `bosh_environment` file.
1. Make sure the EC2 security group you are using in the `Vagrantfile` exists and allows inbound TCP traffic on ports 25555 (for the BOSH director), 22 (for SSH), 80/443 (for Cloud Controller), and 4443 (for Loggregator).
1. Run Vagrant from the `aws` folder:

    ```
    cd aws
    vagrant up --provider=aws
    cd ..
    ```
1. Find out the public IP of the box you just launched. You can see this info at the end of `vagrant up` output. Another way is running `vagrant ssh-config` under `aws` folder.


1. Target the BOSH Director and login with admin/admin.

    ```
    $ bosh target <public_ip_of_the_box>
    Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
    $ bosh login
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as `admin'
    ```

1. Edit manifests/cf-stub-spiff.yml to include a 'domain' key under 'properties' that corresponds to a domain you've set up for this Cloud Foundry instance, or if you want to use xip.io, it can be {your.public.ip}.xip.io.

1. Direct future traffic received on the instance to another ip (the HAProxy):

```
INTERNAL_IP=<internal IP of instance>
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $INTERNAL_IP --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.244.0.34:80
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $INTERNAL_IP --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 10.244.0.34:443
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $INTERNAL_IP --dport 4443 -j DNAT --to 10.244.0.34:4443
```

These rules are cleared on restart. They can be saved and configured to be reloaded on startup if so desired, assuming granted the internal IP address remains the same.

##### AWS Environment Variables

|Name|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|BOSH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID         |AWS access key ID                    | |
|BOSH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY     |AWS secret access key                | |
|BOSH_LITE_KEYPAIR              |AWS keypair name                     |bosh|
|BOSH_LITE_NAME                 |AWS instance name                    |Vagrant|
|BOSH_LITE_SECURITY_GROUP       |AWS security group                   |inception|
|BOSH_LITE_PRIVATE_KEY          |path to private key matching keypair |~/.ssh/id_rsa_bosh|
|[VPC only] BOSH_LITE_SUBNET_ID |AWS VPC subnet ID                    | |

#### Using knife solo on a bare-metal Ubuntu box

This guide assumes you have already installed `Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (64-bit)` on your box.
And have correctly configured ssh access.

1. Prepare you box by installing chef

```
STATIC_IP=<ip of your box>
knife solo prepare root@$STATIC_IP
```

2. Edit the created node file

```
sed "s/STATIC_IP/$STATIC_IP/g" nodes/example_node.json > nodes/$STATIC_IP.json
```

3. Install bosh-lite

```
knife solo cook root@$STATIC_IP
```

## Restart the Director

Occasionally you need to restart the BOSH Lite Director to avoid [this bug](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite/issues/82) so perhaps always run the following after booting up BOSH Lite:

```
vagrant ssh -c "sudo sv restart director"
```

## Upload the Warden stemcell

A stemcell is a VM template with an embedded BOSH Agent. BOSH Lite uses the Warden CPI, so we need to use the Warden Stemcell which will be the root file system for all Linux Containers created by the Warden CPI.

1. Download latest Warden stemcell

    ```
    wget http://bosh-jenkins-gems-warden.s3.amazonaws.com/stemcells/latest-bosh-stemcell-warden.tgz
    ```

1. Upload the stemcell

    ```
    bosh upload stemcell latest-bosh-stemcell-warden.tgz
    ```

NOTE: It is possible to do this in one command instead of two, but doing this in two steps avoids having to download the stemcell again when you bring up a new BOSH Lite box.

You can also use 'bosh public stemcells' to list and download the latest Warden stemcell

Example (the versions you see will be different from these):

```
$ bosh public stemcells
+---------------------------------------------+
| Name                                        |
+---------------------------------------------+
| bosh-stemcell-1722-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz       |
| bosh-stemcell-1722-aws-xen-centos.tgz       |
| light-bosh-stemcell-1722-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz |
| light-bosh-stemcell-1722-aws-xen-centos.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-1722-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-1722-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-1722-vsphere-esxi-centos.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-24-warden-boshlite-ubuntu.tgz |
+---------------------------------------------+

$ bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-24-warden-boshlite-ubuntu.tgz
```

## Deploy Cloud Foundry

### Single command deploy

Alternatively to the steps below, you can also run this script to deploy the latest version of CloudFoundry:

```
$ ./scripts/provision_cf
```

### Manual deploy

1.  Install [Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff). Use the [latest binary of Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff/releases), extract it, and make sure that `spiff` is in your `$PATH`.

1. Clone a copy of cf-release:
    ```
    cd ~/workspace
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release
    ```

1. Decide which final release of Cloud Foundry you wish to deploy by looking at in the [releases directory of cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/releases).  At the time of this writing, cf-169 is the most recent. We will use that as the example, but you are free to substitute any future release.

1. Check out the desired revision of cf-release, (eg, 169)

    ````
    cd ~/workspace/cf-release
    ./update
    git checkout v169
    ````

1.  Upload final release

    Use the version that matches the tag you checked out. For v169 you would use: releases/cf-169.yml

    ```
    bosh upload release releases/cf-<version>.yml
    ```
    If the BOSH binary was not found and you use RVM, BOSH was most likely installed into the bosh-lite gemset. Switch to the gemset before uploading:

    ```
    rvm gemset use bosh-lite
    bundle
    bosh upload release releases/cf-<version>.yml
    ```

1.  Use the `make_manifest_spiff` script to create a cf manifest.  This step assumes you have cf-release checked out in ~/workspace. If you have cf-release checked out to somewhere else, you have to update the `CF_RELEASE_DIR`
 +environment variable.  The script also requires that cf-release is checked out with the tag matching the final release you wish to deploy so that the templates used by `make_manifest_spiff` match the code you are deploying.

    `make_manifest_spiff` will target your BOSH Lite Director, find the UUID, create a manifest stub and run spiff to generate a manifest at manifests/cf-manifest.yml. If this fails, try updating Spiff.

    ```
    cd ~/workspace/bosh-lite
    ./scripts/make_manifest_spiff
    ```

    If you want to change the jobs properties for this bosh-lite deployment, e.g. number of nats servers, you can change it in the template located under cf-release/templates/cf-infrastructure-warden.yml.


1.  Deploy CF to bosh-lite

    ```
    bosh deployment manifests/cf-manifest.yml # This will be done for you by make_manifest_spiff
    bosh deploy
    # enter yes to confirm
    ```

1.  Run the [cf-acceptance-tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests) against your new deployment to make sure it's working correctly.

    a.  Install [Go](http://golang.org/) version 1.2.1 64-bit and setup the Go environment.

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/go
    export GOPATH=~/go
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    b.  Download the cf-acceptance-tests repository

    ```
    go get github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests ...
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests
    ```
    c.  Follow the [cats](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests) instructions on Running the tests.


## Try your Cloud Foundry deployment

Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) and run the following:

```
cf api http://api.10.244.0.34.xip.io
cf auth admin admin
cf create-org me
cf target -o me
cf create-space development
cf target -s development
```
	
Now you are ready to run commands such as `cf push`.	


## SSH into deployment jobs

Use `bosh ssh` to SSH into running jobs of a deployment.

### For local providers:

Run the following command:

```
scripts/add-route
```

Now you can SSH into any VM with `bosh ssh`:

```
$ bosh ssh
1. nats/0
2. syslog_aggregator/0
3. postgres/0
4. uaa/0
5. login/0
6. cloud_controller/0
7. loggregator/0
8. loggregator-router/0
9. health_manager/0
10. dea_next/0
11. router/0
Choose an instance:
```

Note: `bosh shh` automatically finds and uses the first key from your ssh keychain. If you do not have any RSA keys, you must create one. In a unix environment, this can be accomplished using `ssh-keygen`. You can then and add it to your keychain or you can pass the public key file to the command `bosh ssh --public_key /path/of/public/key`.

### For AWS provider:

SSH into any VM with `bosh ssh` providing `--gateway_identity_file, --gateway_host and --gateway_user`

```
$  bosh ssh --gateway_identity_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa_bosh  --gateway_host=AWS_IP --gateway_user=ubuntu
1. nats/0
2. syslog_aggregator/0
3. postgres/0
4. uaa/0
5. login/0
6. cloud_controller/0
7. loggregator/0
8. loggregator-router/0
9. health_manager/0
10. dea_next/0
11. router/0
Choose an instance:
```

## Restore your deployment

The Warden container will be lost after a vm reboot, but you can restore your deployment with `bosh cck`, BOSH's command for recovering from unexpected errors.
```
$ bosh cck
```

Choose `2` to recreate each missing VM:
```
Problem 1 of 13: VM with cloud ID `vm-74d58924-7710-4094-86f2-2f38ff47bb9a' missing.
  1. Ignore problem
  2. Recreate VM using last known apply spec
  3. Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
Please choose a resolution [1 - 3]: 2
...
```
Type yes to confirm at the end:
```
Apply resolutions? (type 'yes' to continue): yes

Applying problem resolutions
  missing_vm 212: Recreate VM using last known apply spec (00:00:13)
  missing_vm 215: Recreate VM using last known apply spec (00:00:08)
...
Done                    13/13 00:03:48
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Starting over again is often the quickest path to success; you can use `vagrant destroy` from the base directory of this project to remove the VM.
1. To start with a new VM, just execute the appropriate `vagrant up` command, optionally passing in the provider as shown in the earlier sections.

## Manage your local boxes

We publish pre-built Vagrant boxes on Amazon S3. It is recommended to use the latest boxes.

### Download latest boxes

Just get a latest copy of the Vagrantfile from this repo and run `vagrant up`.
